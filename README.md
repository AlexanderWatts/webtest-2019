# CoInvestor Developer Test 2019

In this project I used JavaScript to make requests to the GitHub API and to handle the responses. I made use of features from ES6 including arrow functions and template literals.

## Fetching data

To get the data I used the Fetch API instead of using `XMLHttpRequest` avoiding the pyramid of doom with functions like `then()` and reducing the amount of code needed to be written.

## Tools

Instead of using cURL to test each API request I used the application Postman which made it easier to visualise the responses and to set the request headers including authentication.
