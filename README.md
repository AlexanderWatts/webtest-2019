# CoInvestor Developer Test 2019

Github allows people to plan & track work using [project boards](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-project-boards). These boards allow us to order tickets by priority, as well as to move them between stages in order to keep track of each tickets current status.

What we'd like, is for you to create a tickets listing page. This page should allow someone to pull information from multiple project boards at once in to a single screen. To do this you will need to use the [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/), as well as to design a page to show this information in a visually appealing way.

### Goal
Use the [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/) to create a web page that combines all issues from our [GitHub Project Boards](https://github.com/CoInvestor/webtest-2019/projects).

Your solution should:

* Use the language of your choice (We mostly use PHP/JS ourselves, but are happy to see solutions in other languages)
* Pull ticket data from the GitHub API (you will need to handle authentication)
* Support combining data from multiple GitHub project boards
* Display the tickets on a visually appealing web page. Please be sure to highlight the issue number, title, creation date, originating board & author.
* Feel free to use 3rd party libraries where appropriate.
* Attempt to make it clear which board tickets originated from.

### Getting Started

* Fork this repository into your own GitHub account so you can create a pull request later

### Submission

* Ensure you have not included any GitHub or other credentials in your submission
* Create a pull request to https://github.com/CoInvestor/webtest-2019/ - feel free to use the pull request to add any notes/thoughts around how you chose to solve this.

#### Design mock up
A rough mockup of the sort of thing you may want to create.

Please feel free to use your own judgement on how best to display the required information in your final work, this is an example only and is incomplete. You are free to approach differently if preferred.
